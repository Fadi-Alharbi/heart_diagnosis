The goal of this code is to build and evaluate multiple machine learning classification models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, and KNN) to predict the presence of heart disease using a cleaned medical dataset. The code loads the data, preprocesses it, splits it into training and testing sets, then trains each model and measures its performance using accuracy, precision, and recall. Additionally, it extracts one example of a diseased patient and one healthy patient from the dataset, providing simple rule-based explanations for why each was classified as such based on key features like age, maximum heart rate (thalach), thalium stress test results (thal), and number of major vessels (ca).
